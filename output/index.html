<p>I've decided to run for Selectboard for Windsor, VT.</p>
<p>I'm very grateful to live in this place, and I would like to give back to the community that raised me. </p>
<p>These days, there's a buzz of renewed energy in the air about town. I believe our future is bright if we can capitalize on that energy to sustain growth and progress.
We are surrounded by good friends and kind folks. We have green treasure literally called "Paradise" and wouldn't-ya-know-it there's an honest to goodness nightlife!</p>
<p>All in a historic downtown in which the fruits of our continuing revitalization have only just begun to materialize.</p>
<p>This is not free, all of this is made manifest by the hearts and hard work of the people of Windsor.</p>
<p>For decades Windsor has been defined by what we lack and what we've lost. I think it's time to take control of our message and define ourselves. </p>
<ul>
<li>I think it's worth the effort for town government to reach out and communicate directly with people.</li>
<li>I think it's worth the effort to go out of your way to listen to how your neighbors are doing. </li>
<li>I think it's worth the effort, because the impact and force of the work we do is multiplied exponentially when we actually work together.</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to turn raw energy in usable power? Then you must understand the the engine, take care of it, and give it what it needs to accelerate.</p>
<p>In order to truly cultivate our renewed energy, I believe we must <em>put in</em> energy and be active facilitators of coordinated effort.
We absolutely can have a strong, affordable, safe and resilient town that is home for neighbors old and new. We do. It's awesome. Let's keep it going together.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't have every answer... but I will lean on the expertise of my peers and wisdom of our elders. I will listen and try to create more chances to do so publicly and consistently. If elected, I will use my brain and heart in equal measure in serving as a member of the Windsor Selectboard. </p>

<p>"Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.</p>
<p>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to "not matter". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.</p>
<p>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.</p>
<p>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.</p>
<p>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."</p>

<p>This summer I set about bringing a crazy idea to fruition. I wanted a community dance party, and I wanted it to be fun and accepting of the widest possible net. All i could think about was Motown music. And thus "Wotown" was born!</p>
<p>If you're completely clueless as to what I'm talking about, just read the link below...</p>
<p>... I'm just stunned at the kind words. My good friend Taylor Long, the author, really captured the feeling and spirit of Wotown so perfectly.</p>
<p>Seriously, I can't thank you enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://junctionmagazine.com/wotown">Wotown by Taylor Long on the Junction Magzazine</a></p>
<p>At some point after the last Wotown event is done, I'll write up some debriefing thoughts and post them here... </p>

<p>Automations save you from doing annoyingly repetetive things. Things such as pulling public ssh keys from your users' github page. <code>keyscrape</code> will do just that, and save the output in a nice, easy to read text file. You could easily use this to populate an inventory of some sort.</p>
<p>It's all nice and dockerized, too...</p>
